Description: In recent years a wealth of biological data has become
    available in public data repositories. Easy access to these
    valuable data resources and firm integration with data analysis is
    needed for comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis.  biomaRt
    provides an interface to a growing collection of databases
    implementing the BioMart software suite (http://www.biomart.org).
    The package enables retrieval of large amounts of data in a uniform
    way without the need to know the underlying database schemas or
    write complex SQL queries. Examples of BioMart databases are
    Ensembl, COSMIC, Uniprot, HGNC, Gramene, Wormbase and dbSNP mapped
    to Ensembl. These major databases give biomaRt users direct access
    to a diverse set of data and enable a wide range of powerful online
    queries from gene annotation to database mining.
