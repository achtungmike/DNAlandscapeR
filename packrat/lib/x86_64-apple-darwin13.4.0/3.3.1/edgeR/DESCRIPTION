Title: Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R
Description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression
    profiles with biological replication. Implements a range of
    statistical methodology based on the negative binomial
    distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests,
    generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as
    RNA-seq, it be applied to differential signal analysis of other
    types of genomic data that produce counts, including ChIP-seq, SAGE
    and CAGE.
