<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<h5>
We designed <b>DNAlandscapeR</b> to provide a visualization of epigenetic data,
particularly three-dimensional chromatin structures from ChIA-PET and HiC experiments,
in a computationally efficient framework. These tracks can be viewed immediately alongside
other epigenetic tracks, such as DNA methylation, transcription binding intensities, and
RNA expression.
<br><br>Check out our <b>Guide</b> tab for more details on the user experience.
