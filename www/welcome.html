<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<h4>
We designed <b>DNAlandscapeR</b> to provide a visualization of epigenetic data,
particularly three-dimensional chromatin structures from ChIA-PET and HiC experiments,
in a computationally efficient framework. These tracks can be viewed immediately alongside
other epigenetic tracks, such as DNA methylation, transcription binding intensities, and
RNA expression.
<br><br>Immediately below, we have a sample plot that can be quickly generated using
this browser. Check out our <b>Guide</b> tab for details on the user experience.

domain is more transcriptionally active as evidenced by POL2 loops, gene bodies, and H3K27me3 peaks. </h4>

Try loading some sample data by first clicking the button
below. Next, navigate to the <b>Visualize</b> tab up top. Once you're there, hit the <b>Plot Region</b>
buttons to visualize the three-dimensional loops that span the CTCF peaks, which can be viewed underneath from ChIA-PET data,
in the GM12878 cell line. We can view the overall
three-dimensional structure from a Hi-C experiment, and compare the topological domains in the GM12878 cell line with
those in the IMR90 cell line. Overall, this sample plot shows some of the variability in the three-dimensional structure 
of the two cell lines, confirms correspondence of Hi-C topological domains and ChIA-PET loops, and verifies that loop anchors 
correspond to regions of CTCF binding.
