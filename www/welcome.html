<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<h4>
We designed <b>DNAlandscapeR</b> to provide a visualization of epigenetic data,
particularly three-dimensional chromatin structures from ChIA-PET and HiC experiments,
in a computationally efficient framework. These tracks can be viewed immediately alongside
other epigenetic tracks, such as DNA methylation, transcription binding intensities, and
RNA expression. </h4>

domain is more transcriptionally active as evidenced by POL2 loops, gene bodies, and H3K27me3 peaks. </h4>
