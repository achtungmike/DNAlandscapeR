<h3><b>About</b></h3>
<h4>
We designed <b>DNAlandscapeR</b> to provide a visualization of epigenetic data,
particularly three-dimensional chromatin structures from ChIA-PET and HiC experiments,
in a computationally efficient framework. These tracks can be viewed immediately alongside
other epigenetic tracks, such as DNA methylation, transcription binding intensities, and
RNA expression.

Try loading some sample data by first clicking the button
below. Next, navigate to the <b>Visualize</b> tab up top. Once you're there, hit one of the <b>Plot</b>
buttons to visualize a CTCF ChIP-Seq track from GM12878 at the top. We may be interested in the three-dimensional loops that span
these CTCF peaks, which can be viewed underneath from ChIA-PET data. We can confirm that regions on the DNA that
anchor these interactions have open chromatin realized by DNase hypersensitivity. Finally, we can view the overall
three-dimensional structure from a Hi-C experiment, and compare the topological domains in the GM12878 cell line with
those in the IMR90 cell line. Overall, this sample plot shows some of the variability in the three-dimensional structure 
of the two cell lines, confirms correspondence of Hi-C topological domains and ChIA-PET loops, and verifies that loop anchors 
correspond to regions of open chromatin and histone binding.
