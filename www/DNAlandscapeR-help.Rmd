### **Interactive Zooming**

After selecting a region, one can simply double click to zoom over the specified region. The boundaries of the shaded box will define the new x-coordinates in the updated plot. The y-coordinates of the box do not have an effect on the ensuing zoom.

### **Uploading Local Data**
While **DNAlandscapeR** provides a wide variety of epigenetic data for both mouse and human, users may wish to include their own data to visualize in the browser.
